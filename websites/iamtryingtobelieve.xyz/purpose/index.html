When early ve<span class="left">rsions of Pa</span>repin first went into our water supply, the brief outcry was <br />

<span class="bigWhite">Parepin as a key defense</span>.

even risking the occasional “serious” side effect... so long as I felt safe.
<br /><br />
Then I met an old friend of mine.  He seemed <span class="bigWhite">different from everyone <br />

said he’d been off Parepin during the northeastern bio-attack in ‘19 and <span class="bigWhite">didn’t <br />

I know what my answer was for a long time.  I didn’t care a bit about being <br />
<span class="bigWhite">constipated, or twitchy</span>, or <span class="bigWhite">losing most of my sex drive</span>, or <br />
even risking the occasional “serious” side effect... so long as I felt safe.
<br /><br />
Then I met an old friend of mine.  He seemed <span class="bigWhite">different from everyone <br />
else.  Sharper.  Healthier, even</span>.  He told me he’d been off Parepin for <br />
<span class="bigWhite">four years solid</span>.  I didn’t believe him at first, but he was very convincing.  He <br />
said he’d been off Parepin during the northeastern bio-attack in ‘19 and <span class="bigWhite">didn’t <br />

on every day.  What if Parepin isn’t the antidote, but the <br />

<span style="font-size:24px; font-weight:bold;">What if Parepin is bio-terrorism?</span>

Think about it.  And if one day you’re feeling plucky, try a little vacation from the public <br />
water supply.  See if things don’t seem a lot clearer.
