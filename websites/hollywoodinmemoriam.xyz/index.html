The first dirty bomb went off at the Kodak Theater during the 81st Annual Academy Awards Ceremony.  Over the next <br />
half hour, eight more dirty bombs deployed by Islamic extremists spread a pall of radioactive dust across Greater LA.  <br />
Three days later a Presidential order required the entire city to be evacuated.
<br /><br />
The City of Angels had become a city of ghosts.

This site is dedicated to the people of Los Angeles who lost their homes, their loved ones, and their lives in Hollywood's <br />
