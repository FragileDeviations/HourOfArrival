<br /><br /><br />
Dear Danny (or Jane) —<br /><br />The news crawl on this computer is reporting a Pres<span class="leftUp">ence sighting ove</span>r Minneapolis. <br /><br />I just got off the phone with your Aunt Chrissy.  She’s at the hospital with your mom.  She <br />says yo<span class="left">u aren’t</span> in any hurry to come into the world just yet.  <br /><br />I don’t blame you.<br /><br />The trouble is, kiddo, I am beginning to think you and I are not d<span class="leftUp">estined to </span>meet.

H<span class="left">ere’s your </span>mom the day we were married.  Wasn’t she beautiful?<br /><br />So Jane—or Danny, if you turn out to<span class="leftUp"> be a boy—it’</span>s just past 3 AM for you in Denver.  <br />5 o’clock in the morning, here in Washington.   <br /><br />Almost dawn.<br /><br />D<span class="one">anny Jane, it isn’</span><!--t the safest world you’re coming into.  That’s my fault.  I’m not making --><br />that up—I work for the government, and my job is to <span class="leftUp">make you sa</span>fe.  Well, lots of people, <br />I suppose, but tonight you are the only one I care about.

Th<span class="leftUp">is is my brot</span>her, Paul.  He would have been your uncle.  But some bad people blew up <br />Los Angeles, which used to be a city with palm trees and Disneyland, and Paul joined the <br />army.  His heli<span class="left">copter got </span>shot down in Yemen a few years ago.  <br /><br />Thi<span class="leftUp">rteen years </span>I’ve been trying to make things safe, and somehow things are always getting <br />worse. <br /><br />I can’t tell you how <span class="two">ashame</span><!--d I am.--><br /><br />

This is a picture of your aunt Chrissy with one of her many asshole boyfriends, the kind <br />who is al<span class="leftUp">ways talki</span>ng about making the world a be<span class="left">tter pla</span>ce but never getting a job.  The <br />last time I stayed at Chrissy’s place this guy threw beer on me.  I didn’t give a shit about <br />the <span class="leftUp">beer, but I </span>was so pissed off with him lying on the couch all day except for “band <br />rehearsals” that I passed along a tip a<span class="leftUp">bout his</span> group to the FBI.  <br /><br />A few months later the boyfriend disappeared.  Of course Chrissy hated me.  What was <br />eas<span class="left">ier for her:  </span>believing he left her for the next good lay w<span class="leftUp">ho wouldn’</span>t nag him about the <br />rent—or believing that he was a Resistance Hero, s<span class="leftUp">pirited off to</span> Guam by my fascist <br />minions?

I was s<span class="left">upposed to be</span> there with your mom to see you into the world.  But work, you know….<br /><br />I’m sure she isn’t surprised.  I think she learned a long ti<span class="leftUp">me ago that </span>work is just another <br />w<span class="leftUp">ord for bro</span>ken promises.<br /><br />…When I was a boy my dad showed me how to catch a cricket in my cupped hands.  He’d let <br />me hold it for a f<span class="left">ew seconds, j</span>ust to feel it flick and flutter against my palms.  3 months <br />ago, that’s what you were like.  There was more r<span class="leftUp">oom back th</span>en and you would be<br />tumbling and flipping about—you were so active!—and your mother would grab my hand and <br />put it on her belly and say, “See?”  And I could feel you moving in there, bumping and <br />flutt<span class="leftUp">ering agai</span>nst my hand.<br /><br />I had this joke all plan<span class="leftUp">ned out </span>for today.  After you were born, the nurses would see how <br />acti<span class="left">ve you a</span>re, how alert, and they would say something like, “Look at this kid, checking <br />out the room!” and I was going to say, “This baby wasn’t born yesterday, you know.”<br /><span style="padding-left:250px;">*</span><br />More Presence sightings:  Honolulu. Amritsar. <span class="leftUp">Hokkaid</span>o. Helsinki.<br /><span style="padding-left:250px;">*</span><br /><br />I was su<span class="left">pposed to</span> be there with you, but the Presid<span class="left">ent call</span>ed me to Washington to talk <br />about the Presence.<br /><br />What i<span class="left">s the Presen</span>ce?<br /><br />Why, the Prese<span class="one">nce is the firs</span><!--t thing you will see, Danny Jane.  You will be pushed out of--> <br />your warm bed and beaten and squash<span class="left">ed and fina</span>lly cast out into the cold, into the Outer <br />Darkness is what the Bible calls it.  And your mother will be crying with the pain of <br />bea<span class="leftUp">ring you, an</span>d a huge hand will come down from the sky and cut you from her.<br /><br />Only unlike us, you were never to blame.<br /><span style="padding-left:250px;">*</span><br /><br />The Presence see<span class="two">n in Riyadh</span><!-- this hour, and Rouen.  Crete, Saigon, Lesser Slave Lake up--><br /> in Alberta.  Twice in Jamaica in the space of a few min<span class="left">utes.  Sau Pa</span>ulo.  Reykjavik.  <br />Suburbs of Aukland.<br /><br />And it’s beginning to look very much like the end.<br /><br />H<span class="leftUp">ere’s what Da</span>ddy was working on until about 45 minutes ago.  <br /><br /><img alt="" src="images/graph.jpg" /><br /><br /><br /> I got this far and looked at it and left my computer.  Got a little bottle of scotch from <br />the mini-bar in my hotel room and looked out the w<span class="leftUp">indow at Wash</span>ington, and thought of <br />you and your mother, so far away.<br /><span style="padding-left:250px;">*</span><br /><br /><i>The g<span class="left">oddam Prese</span>nce.

Sometimes the Syrian militias sho<span class="one">ot at it, thinki</span><!--ng it must be some --><br />weapon of our devising.  <br /><br />They will realize, soon enough, that it isn’t war:  it’s the end of all our wars.  Maybe <br />the end of us, one way or another.<br /><br />I hav<span class="left">en’t slept in th</span>ree days.

This is the house where I grew up.  I guess it’s nothing special but I wanted you to see <br />it.  <br /><br />When the Pre<span class="left">sence came, for</span> the first few days we didn’t know what to do.  We upped <br />the Parepin in the water near every sighting, just to keep people from panicking, you <br />know?  We thought maybe it was a wea<span class="two">pon or the we</span><!--ather or some fucking subversive --><br />pra<span class="one">nk, those litt</span><!--le streetcorner shitheads, give them a spray-paint can think they’re --><br />fucking Zorro, while I spend my days sending agents out to die so they don’t have to <br />pray to Mecca 5 times and day.<br /><span style="padding-left:250px;">*</span><br /><br />Flashback:  yesterday.  I’m takin<span class="leftUp">g the train i</span>nto work, a girl gets on—twenty-five, <br />may<span class="left">be.  Square gla</span>sses, jean jacket and a black skirt, no stockings, but a scorpion <br />tattooed on her calf.  Full of life.  When the train got to her station the doors hissed <br />open, she turned and lo<span class="leftUp">oked over h</span>er shoulder at me and smiled and I smiled back <br />and she gave me the finger. <br /><br />Fuck you, old man.  <br /><br />Fuck you, Washin<span class="one">gton pig.  Fuc</span><!--k you because you like the way I look but you’re --><br />we<span class="leftUp">aring slack</span>s and a belt.  Fuck you because there’s a logo on your briefcase, you <br />are Them you are the Enemy.  <br /><br />And you can’t say, All I ever want<span class="two">ed to do wa</span><!--s keep you safe.  But if she got on a --><br />train in fucking Syria in that get up they would cut off her hands. <br /><br />None of Au<span class="leftUp">nt Chrissy’s f</span>riends want to hear that.  They are full of liberal righteousness, <br />which means that it’s better to let foreigners rot in hell than to lift a finger to save them <br />and be thought a bully.  <br /><br />Chrissy likes to think all our wars are about oil.  It ma<span class="one">kes the worl</span><!--d simple for her--> <br />because if it’s all just greedy tycoons somewhere there are no hard choices and she never<br /> has to be a bad guy.<br /><br />I have a mas<span class="left">ter’s degre</span>e in political economics from Yale.  She has an arts degree from a <br />city college.  I spend 12 and 14 hour days going through State Department briefs, CIA <br />analysis papers, raw and edited surveillance footage, age<span class="leftUp">nt reports, a</span>nd satellite data.  <br />She reads a couple of liberal blogs and lectures me on the state of the world every time <br />we meet.  Am I *aware* of the *cost* of the Syrian campaign?<br /><br />I keep waiting for her to realize her own colossal arrogance, but it never happens.  In <br />Chrissy’s wo<span class="one">rld, facts don’t</span><!-- matter and hard choices don’t exist.  Policies are like rock--> <br />bands:  mine is cool and yours sucks, and if mainstream people like it, it must suck ASS.

We thought maybe it was a weapon or the weather or some fucking subversive <br />prank, those little streetcorner shitheads, give them a spray-paint can think they’re <br />fucking Zorro, while I spend my days sending agents out to die so they don’t have to <br />pray to Mecca 5 times and day.<br /><span style="padding-left:250px;">*</span><br /><br />Flashback:  yesterday.  I’m taking the train into work, a girl gets on—twenty-five, <br />maybe.  Square glasses, jean jacket and a black skirt, no stockings, but a scorpion <br />tattooed on her calf.  Full of life.  When the train got to her station the doors hissed <br />open, she turned and looked over her shoulder at me and smiled and I smiled back <br />and she gave me the finger. <br /><br />Fuck you, old man.  <br /><br />Fuck you, Washington pig.  Fuck you because you like the way I look but you’re <br />wearing slacks and a belt.  Fuck you because there’s a logo on your briefcase, you <br />are Them you are the Enemy.  <br /><br />And you can’t say, All I ever wanted to do was keep you safe.  But if she got on a <br />train in fucking Syria in that get up they would cut off her hands. <br /><br />None of Aunt Chrissy’s friends want to hear that.  They are full of liberal righteousness, <br />which means that it’s better to let foreigners rot in hell than to lift a finger to save them <br />and be thought a bully.  <br /><br />Chrissy likes to think all our wars are about oil.  It makes the world simple for her <br />because if it’s all just greedy tycoons somewhere there are no hard choices and she never<br /> has to be a bad guy.<br /><br />I have a master’s degree in political economics from Yale.  She has an arts degree from a <br />city college.  I spend 12 and 14 hour days going through State Department briefs, CIA <br />analysis papers, raw and edited surveillance footage, agent reports, and satellite data.  <br />She reads a couple of liberal blogs and lectures me on the state of the world every time <br />we meet.  Am I *aware* of the *cost* of the Syrian campaign?<br /><br />I keep waiting for her to realize her own colossal arrogance, but it never happens.  In <br />Chrissy’s world, facts don’t matter and hard choices don’t exist.  Policies are like rock <br />bands:  mine is cool and yours sucks, and if mainstream people like it, it must suck ASS.

This is your grandpa before the stroke.  We didn’t agree on one damn thing.  I wish you <br />could have met him then, before the wheelchair and the feeding tubes.  Before he was <br />just a hideous chore in a nursing home.  <br /><br />My Dad was kind and gentle and let people walk all over him.  I hated that.  <br /><br />Now I wish I had been kinder when i had the chance.

This is your grandma.  Sometimes she looks at me, and I can see her searching in my face <br />for the boy she knew, and I feel ashamed.<br /><span style="padding-left:250px;">*</span><br /><br />Boise.  Instanbul.  Cape Town.  Macao.  Buenos Aires.  Munster.  Brisbane.  Isolated <br />reports of the Presence coming in from California ranger stations, high up in the Sierras.<br /><br />So we were in a place called The Situation Room, the President and all the Consortium<br /> hotshots, everybody spinning and spinning… “blame it on the Arabs” “blame it on the <br />Indians” “blame it on the dissidents” and i just listened to them talk, it was like dogs <br />barking, Danny Jane.  Crows screeching.<br /><br />The time for blame is over.  The time for arabs and dissidents and miners <br />and strikers and soldiers and business and anything but mercy.

We tried to make the world safe for you, Danny Jane, but we tried all the wrong things <br />and nothing worked.  The sky is full of terror and the world is falling down.  We tried <br />and we failed, but we didn’t mean it to end this way, I swear to you.  I swear to you.<br /><br />You can’t pack a good snowball with mittens on.  The rule of 3s will make grade school <br />math easy for you, if Mom remembers to teach it to you.  Never answer chain letters but <br />always make a wish when you blow out the candles on your birthday cake.  <br /><br />Tell Aunt Chrissy I love her in spite of everything.  Tell your mom … tell your mom I was <br />wrong about not getting a cat.   And all those times I told her I didn’t care about her <br />first grey hairs?  I wasn’t lying.  <br /><br />Tell her I should have laughed more at her jokes.<br /><br /><br />It’s so stupid, Danny Jane.  We get scared and our hearts dry up.  Don’t be scared.  Please <br />God let me get home safe tomorrow and I swear I will quit my stupid government job and <br />do nothing but fill you up with courage.  I will take spiders out of the house for you, and <br />buy you roller skates, and teach you how to catch crickets with your bare hands.  <br /><span style="padding-left:250px;">*</span><br />Bangkok, Antwerp, Plano, Heidelberg, Beirut and Tel Aviv, St. Petersburg, Lhasa, Bangalore, <br />Seoul, Portland, Plymouth—faster and faster, the cities pouring in.  The great hand playing <br />like lightning over the face of the world.<br /><span style="padding-left:250px;">*</span><br />Happy Birthday, Danny Jane.  <br /><br />When they pull you squalling into life, you yell and you keep yelling.  Love as hard as you <br />can as long as you can.  When that big hand comes down for you, nothing else will matter <br />any more. <br /><br />At the end—and this is what I’ve learned, and I don’t know why it took so <br />long—at the end, everything dissolves.  At the end, everything you thought mattered burns <br />away and all that’s left is love and ashes.<br /><br /><br /><br />ITS HERE<br /><br /><br /><br />o my god, dj, it’s over the capitol.  o my god, o my god i’m so sorry.  <br /><br />this is the beginning<br /><br />the stars are blowing out like candles, danny jane  <br /><br />make a wish make a wish make a wish make a wish make a
