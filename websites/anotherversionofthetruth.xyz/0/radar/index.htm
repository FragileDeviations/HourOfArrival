<span style="font-weight:bold; font-style:italic;">Yesterday Early Morning</span>
<br /><br />
I tried to book a 5 AM slot at my local r<span class="left">ink yester</span>day but it was already taken by some <br />
hotshot Uk<span class="left">rainian pa</span>irs coach.  Finally I begged for the 4:30 – 5:00 slot, told the guy I <br />
knew where the lights were and he could leave the key under a mat outside the back <br />
entrance.
<br /><br />
Cold ice, cold boards, old skates I hadn’t put on in years.  Lacing them up with a skate <br />
key, tight as tourniquets around my ankles.
<br /><br />
Steel hissing on the ice.
<br /><br />
The trouble with paranoia is, once you start, th<span class="left">ere’s nowh</span>ere to go but down.
<br /><br />
Here’s the thing:  no further outbreaks of Red Horse.  
<br /><br />
Meaning, everybody who <span class="left">contrac</span>ted the disease stayed in the building.  Everyone who <br />
got away, got out before they were breathed on or bled on or <span class="left">what have y</span>ou.  Thank god.
<br /><br />
So<span class="left">metimes</span> miracles happen.
<br /><br />
But recreate the situation.  A jihadist (or his victim) is strung <span class="left">out on Red Ho</span>rse.  He plunges <br />
into a crowded nightclub.  A fight breaks out.  A few people are cut.  Maybe a couple of <br />
people die.  Maybe the bouncers step in.  Maybe somebody calls the cops or the ambulance.  <br />
There’s a crowd, because there is always a crowd.  And there are runners, because there <br />
are alwa<span class="left">ys runn</span>ers.
<br /><br />
Nobody exposed to the virus tries to get out of there before the cops and EMT’s arrive?  Of <br />
course they do.  Of course they do.
<br /><br />
Only the doors are locked.
<br /><br />
The only way the equation makes sense is if the do<span class="left">ors were locked be</span>fore I ordered them <br />
locked.
<br /><br />
If they were locked the minute the vector went downstairs.
<br /><br />
I still take res<span class="left">ponsibility</span> for ordering them all to die.  That happened.  
<br /><br />
But somebody else was there before me.
<br /><br />
<span style="padding-left:250px;">*</span>
<br /><br />
The thing about competitive figure skating is, there are no secrets.  <span class="left">Not in comp</span>etition.  You <br />
go out into the circle of blazing light in front of a panel of judges and ten thousand people in <br />
the stands and there is no place to hide.  For four minutes, it is the most exposed place on <br />
the planet.
<br /><br />
And for t<span class="left">hat reas</span>on, in a strange way, the cleanest.
<br /><br />
<span style="padding-left:250px;">*</span>
<br /><br />
It was good to feel the ice under me again.  At first I stayed c<span class="left">lose to the boa</span>rds, getting my <br />
legs back.  I ramped it up, skating fast, crossover turns, my elbows brushing the fiberglass.  <br />
A half-turn, skating bac<span class="left">kwards now</span>, still faster than most hockey players can skate going <br />
forwards.  Madame Olga used to make money tea<span class="left">ching hock</span>ey players how to skate.  Raced <br />
them at the beginning of every camp, dumpy in her furs and chain smoking.  Every year another <br />
generation of guys drop-jawed to learn that on the best day of their lives they can’t skate with <br />
a fat middle-aged figure skater.
<br /><br />
For some reason, it was ve<span class="left">ry difficu</span>lt to get away from the boards and skate into the middle <br />
of the ice.
<br /><br />
<span style="padding-left:250px;">*</span>
<br /><br />
If you accept that the nightclub doors were locked as soon as the ve<span class="left">ctor went</span> into the building, <br />
everything gets simple.  Black, but simple.
<br /><br />
A terrorist wants a plague to spread, doesn’t he?  He doesn’t want it contained.
<br /><br />
Or say he does.  Say this is a warning shot across our bow.  Wouldn’t our terrorist try … a <br />
gov<span class="left">ernment off</span>ice?  An army base?  A school gymnasium?  Doesn’t it seem odd that an IA <br />
operative would target a pack of college kids full of dis<span class="left">sident</span> ideals?
<br /><br />
<span style="padding-left:250px;">*</span>
<br /><br />
The worst thing about paranoia is that you don’t know when to stop.  Because if we set up the <br />
business in the Star Chamber, what else might we set up?
<br /><br />
Chopper Park was part of the gang that pulled off 2/22.  I know that because it said so in his 
    <br />
    dossier.  
The dossier that gave the greenlight to go Munich on him.  Written <span class="left">by the peo</span>ple who 
    <br />
    picked me to 
take the lead, take the shot.
<br /><br />
<span style="padding-left:250px;">*</span>
<br /><br />
Around and around <span class="left">the edge of</span> the rink.  Lights dim because I couldn’t stand them bright.   The <br />
horrible naked feeling in my shoulder blades, like someone had a scope on me.
<br /><br />
The click and hiss and scrape of steel on ice.  The sound of my br<span class="left">eathing, get</span>ting louder.  Head 
    <br />
    down.
Heart pounding.
<br /><br /> 
Around and around.  Around and around.
<br /><br />
<span style="padding-left:250px;">*</span>
<br /><br />
What were Gus’s orders?  What would he have done if I had decided to take Park back to the 
    <br />
    mai<span class="left">nland 
fo</span>r interrogation?
<br /><br />
<span style="padding-left:250px;">*</span>
<br /><br />
Only the hiss of skate blades in the darkness.  And I never could force myself to fly out into the 
    <br />
    middle
of the ice, and jump.
<br /><br />
Just circled the baseboards in the dark, leaving little orange tea<span class="left">rdrops on</span> the ice.
<br /><br />
Around and around.
<br /><br />
<span style="padding-left:250px;">*</span>
<br /><br />
Who killed my sister?  Really?
