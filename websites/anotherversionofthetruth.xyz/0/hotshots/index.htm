<br /><br />
My little sister, Tina, was down in LA with friends.  I was stuck at home <span class="left">becau</span>se I had a <br />
com<span class="left">petiti</span>on next weekend.  
<br /><br />	
Mom said, <span style="font-style:italic;">You’re used to things revolving around your schedule, Bianca.  Maybe it’s <br />
time you weren’t the center of <span class="left">attenti</span>on.</span>  
<br /><br />
I hated her so much.
<br /><br />
Mom and Dad were watching the Academy Awards when the bomb went off.  I was <br />
doing ho<span class="left">mewor</span>k.  I had to train at the rink every afternoon so I only went to regular <br />
school until lunchtime and did the rest of my classes by correspond<span class="left">ence.</span>  
<br /><br />
Mom called Tina on the cell phone they got her just for the trip and she said she was <br />
okay, she was in a car with her friend Laila and Laila’s parents and as <span class="left">soon as</span> the traffic <br />
cleared they were going to drive up to San Francisco and get a plane home from there.   
<br /><br />
Tina called later, when everyone was cho<span class="left">king</span> and she was having trouble, too, and Mom <br />
kept saying, <span style="font-style:italic;">baby, I’m here, baby, it’s going to be all right.</span>  
<br /><br />
<span style="padding-left:250px;">*</span>
<br /><br />
The guy in the hazmat suit that they interviewed on TV said that all the time they were <br />
checking cars, they kept hearing cell phones ringing.  Lines of cars pulled every which <br />
way on the freeway with spray paint on the wind<span class="left">shields</span> saying that they were checked <br />
and how many dead were in them.  Phones ringing and ringing, saying, <span style="font-style:italic;">pick up, please <br />
pick up, please.</span>  I called her, even <span class="left">after Mo</span>m and Dad stopped I snuck into my room and <br />
called and called.
