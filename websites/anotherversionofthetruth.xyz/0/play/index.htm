<br /><br />
It’s snowing in Cleveland.  When I was a girl, that used to happen a lot in early February.  <br />
Now, not so much.  Well, you remember.
<br /><br />
I open a <span class="left">wind</span>ow in the office.  I’m at the peak of the rush right now:  my skin so <br />
hypersensitive even a silk blouse feels like sandpaper.  The taste of batteries fills my <br />
mouth and the smell of snow is overpo<span class="left">wer</span>ing.  
<br /><br />
Wake up at 4:30, get to the rink by 5:15, two hours of practice before breakfast.  Skates <br />
laced so tight my feet go numb.  Cold leather, cold ice, stiff fingers, Madame Olga’s fat <br />
sleepy eyes and cigarettes.
<br /><br />
A cascade of <span class="left">memo</span>ries, all dense with smells:  exhaust fumes waiting at the bus stop, <br />
latex gloves stinking of bleach, the harsh chemical tang of the decon team at the Star <br />
Chamber.  And before that, when we first wa<span class="left">lked i</span>n: the smell of 112 bodies two days <br />
dead.
<br /><br />
That must have been what it smelled like after 2/22.  Thousands of cars parked on the LA <br />
fre<span class="left">ewa</span>ys, windows rolled up.  The ultimate American coffins, I-5 like a new Arlington, <br />
glossy tombstones by Chevy and Honda and BMW.
<br /><br />
Is that why I took the job when they offered it?  Partly.  I lost som<span class="left">ethin</span>g that day.
<br /><br />
I hate to lose.
<br /><br />
<span style="padding-left:250px;">*</span>
<br /><br /><br />


A flake of s<span class="left">now co</span>mes in from the night sky:  lands on my arm like a white wasp:  stings.  
<br /><br />
Time to go.
<br /><br />
For obvious security reasons, they don’t let us take our co<span class="left">mput</span>ers home from The Office.  <br />
This one time, that’s going to work out well for me.
<br /><br />
Step 1:  take a new gelled hydrogen power cell and swap it out for the old one in my <br />
m<span class="left">achin</span>e.  The point here is—
<br /><br />
--well, I’ll get to that in time.
