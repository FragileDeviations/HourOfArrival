<span style="font-weight:bold; font-style:italic;">Six years ago.</span>
<br /><br />
My first actual kill.

It was a Munich job, this 2/22 North Korean that grew up in LA.  I begged to be on the <br />
case.  Because of Tina, obv<span class="left">ious</span>ly.  The whole reason I applied to The Office in the first <br />
place.
<br /><br />
This <span class="left">Korea</span>n guy, Jun “Chopper” Park, came out of the LA street art scene, but <br />
somewhere along the line developed a hard-on for Kim Il-Song, appa<span class="left">rently</span>.  Takes all <br />
kinds.  He’d gone on the lam after 2/22, spent time in Asia, finally came back into the US <br />
on a fake <span class="left">passp</span>ort and was holed up in some crap motel in Oahu. 
<br /><br />
Like shooting fish in a barrel, Antolos said. Antolos was my partner on the project.  He’d <br />
lost an uncle in 2/22, so it was per<span class="left">sonal for</span> him too, but not like me.  I think I scared him <br />
a little bit, with my intensity.  
<br /><br />
I spent the flight to Hawaii imagi<span class="left">ning</span> how I would kill this guy.  One of my favorites was, I <br />
would walk in on him cleaning his gun and hold my aim while he scrambled to put it back <br />
together, and just as he was about to slide the last piece into place – Bam! Bam! Bam!
<br /><br />	
When we found the hotel we got the room number.  In the hallway I said, “mine” and <br />
<span class="left">Antol</span>os just nodded.  He understood.  We have a mag card that works like a skeleton key <br />
on any hotel door in the US.  Useful.  I took it out.
<br /><br />
I came into the room gun high.  Park was jerking off. It was surreal and kind of pathetic. <br />
He looked at me for half a second. Not even shocked or scared, just emb<span class="left">arrassed.</span> 
<br /><br />
I f<span class="left">lippe</span>d my gun to semi-automatic and blew his head off.
<br /><br />
I felt like a cop on a TV show and I tried to think of one of those snappy “look who got <br />
the last word” one-liners. But everything I thought of sounded lame, so I bent over and <br />
threw up my breakfast instead.
<br /><br />
Antolos stepped in behind me and stared for a mi<span class="left">nute.</span> “Christ, Sherer. Talk about <br />
getting caught with your pants down.” 
<br /><br />
I’d never seen brains scattered around like that. I let myself heave one more time and <br />
then clamped down, forced myself to stand up and walk out of the room. I holstered my <br />
gun because I was s<span class="left">haki</span>ng so hard I was afraid I’d fire it accidentally.
<br /><br />	
I got a commendation on my record.
