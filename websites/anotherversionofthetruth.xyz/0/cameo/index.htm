They call it the copper.  
<br /><br />
You have to inject it every few days, which can leave <span class="left">embarr</span>assing traces.  They told us <br />
to try shooting up <span class="left">betwe</span>en the webs of your toes.  Most people don’t look there.  
<br /><br />
When I signed up to defend my country, I don’t remember this being in the brochure.
<br /><br />
It’s sup<span class="left">posed</span> to be a vaccine against the IA’s ‘red horse’ bio-weapon.  Apparently all the <br />
Higher Ups are on it—the Board of Directors at Ced<span class="left">ocore</span> and Halli-Bech, Vox Chairman, <br />
POTUS, the NEC Synod.  I guess I should feel honored.
<br /><br />
Trouble is, the vaccine is still in alpha.  There are side effects.
<br /><br />
Physically, the first hour after <span class="left">you shoo</span>t up your skin gets unbelievably sensitive.  The <br />
glands at the back of your mouth keep squ<span class="left">eezing ou</span>t the taste of batteries, and when <br />
you spit, you spit orange.  Orange tears, too.  Orange snot when you have a cold.
<br /><br />
The m<span class="left">ental e</span>ffects are a little harder to deal with.
<br /><br />
You don’t want to go out … big open spaces feel … exposed.  It feels better to be close <br />
to walls.  You like the lights dim.  
<br /><br />
I came back to my apartment one night after a double shift, fl<span class="left">icked</span> on the kitchen light, <br />
saw the c<span class="left">ockro</span>aches running for the baseboards.  That’s me, now, if I have a choice.
<br /><br />
Sometimes I get a laugh imagining what a Board meeting at Halli-Bech must be like.  <br />
A big table in some conference room with nobody exactly sitting at it: <span class="left"> twe</span>nty chairs <br />
pushed back against the wall.  Twenty old white guys in sunglasses.  Nobody meeting <br />
anybody else’s eyes.  Silverfish in pin-striped suits.
<br /><br />
The copper makes you <span class="left">paranoid, to</span>o.  Or maybe that’s the job.  After a few months, <br />
it’s hard to tell the two apart.
