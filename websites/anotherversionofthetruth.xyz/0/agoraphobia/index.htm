<span style="font-weight:bold; font-style:italic;">3 days ago.</span>
<br /><br />
I leave for work at <span class="left">differ</span>ent times every morning, and I take a bunch of different routes to <br />
work and back home.  Basic tradecraft, never leave at the same <span class="left">time or go</span> home at the <br />
same time.  Don’t take the same route every day.  Every so often I see Dwayne’s piece-<br />
of-crap yellow 4 by 4. <span class="left"> Sometim</span>es I park in the lot, sometimes I park on a side street.  
<br /><br />
This time I parked two blocks away.  I’m walking thr<span class="left">ough the p</span>arking lot, I notice a new <br />
car:  Honda sedan with Maryland plates.  I look in the window.  Totally ordinary car interior, <br />
except the driver’s seat has what looks like a satin pillow case over the cloth upholstery.
<br /><br /> 
Dwayne’s get<span class="left">ting into</span> the elevator as I get out. “An old friend of yours is in town for a visit, <br />
Toots.”  It’s probably the first time someone has been <span class="left">call</span>ed “Toots” in the 21st century. <br />
Dwayne’s breath smells like beer and burgers with extra onions.  He scowls over at my <br />
cubicle.
<br /><br />
Antolos is there, <span class="left">grinni</span>ng at me.  Looking great.  Smooth and clean and shiny <span class="left">as a bul</span>let.
<br /><br />
I freeze.  Beside me, Dwayne spins his twenty-sided die on the palm of his hand, scoops <br />
it up, shrugs and scratches himself in a manly place.  “Sure, he’s good looking.  But it ain’t <br />
the tools,” he says.  “It’s the plu<span class="left">mber, ba</span>by.”
<br /><br />
Antolos takes me out to lunch, says he doesn’t work for The Office anymore, wonders if I <br />
would be interested in a job.  I shoot up in the bat<span class="left">hroom</span> between the entrée and dessert <br />
and when I get back to the table with my heightened sense of smell I can now catch the <br />
faint wh<span class="left">iff of</span> battery acid on his clothes.  He is definitely on the copper, too, but the smell <br />
is very faint.  He must not have shot up in two or three days.
<br /><br />
Maybe he’s lying to me, trying to entrap me.  Maybe he’s just a nice guy. <br /><br />

I tell him I’m happy with my current job.  I’m lonely, but the drug is <span class="left">crawl</span>ing under my <br />
skin, so I flinch like a burn victim where the cuffs of my silk shirt rub against my wrists.  <br />

Par<span class="left">anoid, I</span> wedge myself back as far into the booth as I can get and think about what I <br />
would do to him with my fork if he started to pull a gun.
<br /><br />
“Copper?” he says, when nobody is listening.
<br /><br />
“Couldn’t trust you if I wanted to,” I say.  Apo<span class="left">logetic</span>.
<br /><br />
He understands.  “Too bad.”
<br /><br />
<span style="padding-left:250px;">*</span>
<br /><br />
The next morning I asked what I would have to do to retire.  Turns out this job comes <br />
with more bag<span class="left">gage t</span>han you’d think.  Leaving aside the classified information I know, <br />
copper is only administered to people on the federal payroll.  I figured I could just do <br />
without and take my chances if the Red Horse got out of the barn, but it turns out—and <br />
this is the funny part—it turns out the copper re<span class="left">wires </span>you pretty savagely.  Enough that <br />
withdrawal is fatal.
<br /><br />
So much for looking for work in the private sector.
