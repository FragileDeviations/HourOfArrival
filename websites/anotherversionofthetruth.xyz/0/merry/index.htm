<span style="font-weight:bold; font-style:italic;">Early this evening</span>
<br /><br />
Dwayne left at 4:47 exactly.  
<br /><br />
Took a swing by the dun<span class="left">geon.  No</span> sign of Gus.  Out in the parking lot, no sign of the <br />
Honda with the satin pillowcase on the driver’s seat.  
<br /><br />
Used some tradecraft.  
    Found something I wasn’t supposed to see.  
    <br />
    <br />
    Can’t say my
    hopes were <span style="color:#95B3D7">dashed</span>.  Can’t say I was surprised at all.
    <br />
    <br />
    <span style="padding-left:250px;">*</span>
    <br />
    <br />

Som<span class="left">eone has</span> to watch the 
    watchers.  Someone really good.  Someone the watchers 
    <br />
    will never suspect.  
    <br />
    <br />

Someone that doesn’t need the <span class="left">drug to</span> make him paranoid.  Who has another trick 
    <br />
    for never dri<span class="left">ving the</span> same way twice, never leaving work at the same time, never 
    <br />
    ordering the same item off the deli menu.
    <br />
    <br />
    <span style="padding-left:250px;">*</span><br />
    <br />
For the record, I never join<span class="left">ed the serv</span>ice 
    because I loved the game.  Some do.  They are 
    <br />
    the athletes of betrayal.  They don’t 
    need pat<span class="left">riotism</span> or money or fame to do what they 
    <br />
    do.  They lie and cheat and betray 
    for the love of the game itself.
    <br />
    <br />

It’s at least clean.
    <br />
    <br />

I was never like that.  I wanted to 
    protect my country.  I wanted to keep Mom and Dad from 
    <br />
    getting divorced.  I wanted 
    to make it up to Tina that I hated her for going to LA and then 
    <br />
    she died.  You can’t 
    afford to hate the people you love, <span class="left">even for a</span> moment, because they 
    <br />
    can be taken from you.
    <br />
    <br />

What I’m saying is, I’m not like you.  I’m just an amateur.
    <br />
    <br />

But I still like to 
    win.
    <br />
    <br />

You should <span class="left">know that y</span>ou are not the only person reading this.  The first, but 
    not the last.
