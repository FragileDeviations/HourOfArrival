I was in bed when the report came in from the Star Ch<span class="left">amber</span>.  First the DCS started <br />
sniffing key<span class="left">words text</span>ing out of the location.  Then there was a beat cop report.   We had <br />
been at FP Con Charlie for Red Horse for months; within 30 se<span class="left">conds</span> of listening to the <br />
phone scans I knew what was happening.
<br /><br />
I used the drill cha<span class="left">nnel to the</span> local cops and ordered them there at full speed, no sirens, <br />
no radio, no warning of any kind.  I told them to get there, use their tasers to drop <br />
anyone leaving the building, and as soon as they could get into p<span class="left">ositi</span>on, I said, they had <br />
to lock the place down.  Nobody in or out.
<br /><br />
God have mercy on my soul.
<br /><br />
I ran to my car and floored it, roc<span class="left">keting</span> through the empty streets, wondering how we <br />
were going to track down everyone who got out of the building before the cops could arrive.  <br />
I wasn’t sure which was worse:  thinking about the people I had just condemned to death, <br />
the ones who were going to tear each other to pieces—or thinking about the g<span class="left">uy dropp</span>ing his <br />
subversive music down a storm drain as he hurried back to his dorm room, or the girl hiding <br />
her tattoo as she snuck back to her parents’ house, not knowing they might be vectors for <br />
biological <span class="left">terrori</span>sm on a scale we could barely imagine.
<br /><br />
Two minutes before I arrived on scene, the night operator at The Office got a weather report <br />
from Virginia in best Langley style:  100% accurate forecast of something that had already <br />
happened.
<br /><br />
The first cops were already on the scene.  One of them had tasered someone coming through <br />
a door and was looking sick about it.  Padlocks were on and they w<span class="left">ere star</span>ting to string <br />
yellow tape.
<br /><br />
The sounds coming from inside were something out of your worst dream.
<br /><br />
I stayed in the back<span class="left">ground</span>, watching until everything was boarded up and locked down.  When <br />
I couldn’t stand the screaming any more I left.  Instead of going home I went back to The <br />
Office, sat down in my cubicle and watched the news cra<span class="left">wlers for</span> signs of an outbreak <br />
somewhere else.  Hour after hour.
<br /><br />
No outbreak came.  
<br /><br />
By noon the next day we were beginning to smile.  By six that evening there was another <br />
comm<span class="left">endati</span>on on my record.  
<br /><br />
It was a miracle.
