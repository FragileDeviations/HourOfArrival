<span style="font-weight:bold; font-style:italic;">Three years ago.</span>
<br /><br />
After my third mand<span class="left">ator</span>y Foreign Field Rotation I got transferred home to Cleveland.  <br />
Mom was having drinking problems and I needed to be nearby.  
<br /><br />
So I set up shop in the Cleveland Branch.  Nothing about it looks <span class="left">cove</span>rt, high-tech, or <br />
lethal.  The sign on the door says we are the Federal Print Document Control.  We even <br />
have some <span class="left">peop</span>le who actually work on printed matter from the Farm Bureau about <br />
things like the use of Fipronil on Fire Ant mounds.  
<br /><br />
The women (it’s mostly women) who work in the pri<span class="left">nting</span> portion of the office are in <br />
a kind of <span class="left">stran</span>ge gray area.  They have to have clearance, but they’re not operatives.  I <br />
think some of them are washouts.  Lots of people here have cle<span class="left">aran</span>ce who aren’t <br />
operatives.  The administrative staff.  Even Dwayne has to have clearance.  I like <br />
Dwayne.  Ev<span class="left">eryone</span> I work with is very smart, very intense, hi-I’m-just-a-nice-guy-who-<br />
happens-to-know-seven-ways-to-kill-a-man-with-a-stick-of-chewing gum kind of intense.  
<br /><br />
And then there’s Dwayne in his dickies, fifty-some<span class="left">thing</span>, replacing the toilet paper, <br />
offering to meet me for a beer and show me how a mature man is way more fun than <br />
those callow kids my age.  He drives me nuts, but in such a normal way, I almost like it <br />
when he comes over and sits on the edge of my desk and says, “What’s shaking, <br />
be<span class="left">autiful?”</span>  He carries around this twenty-sided die and he fiddles with it all the time.  <br />
Takes it out of his pocket and spins it.  Appa<span class="left">rently</span> he was into D&D when he was a kid.  <br />
Yikes.
<br /><br />
When I first start at The Office, Dwayne is trying to patent an inve<span class="left">ntion</span> that tells you <br />
where your TV remote is when you can’t find it.  He thinks he’ll be a billionaire.  He <br />
knows he’s <span class="left">mean</span>t for bigger things than maintenance.  “Listen, hotshots,” he says, “you <br />
guys are dedicated to a cause and all that, but me, I’m an entrepreneur.”  He explains to <br />
me a lot about the entrepreneurial view of the world, how the entre<span class="left">preneur</span> sees life as a <br />
series of opportunities.  
<br /><br />
Wonder how that patent is coming.
