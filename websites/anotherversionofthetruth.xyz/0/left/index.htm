This is what happens when you are a Junior Analyst I.
<br /><br />
<b>Physical Training</b><br />
This was the easy part.
<br /><br />
There were a few guys in my group who were high sc<span class="left">hool</span> athletes—a basketball player <br />
and a couple of offensive line<span class="left">men</span> from pretty good football teams.  Football is a tough <br />
sport, but it’s not on the same planet as figure skating.  
<br /><br />
All over the <span class="left">coun</span>try little girls in pink dresses get up at 4 in the morning and spend many <br />
hours every day training to go as fast as they can and then throw the<span class="left">mselv</span>es into the air <br />
and land on a surface like greased concrete.  Figure skating is like NASCAR:  the crashes <br />
are the only thing that matters.  The difference is, the little girls don’t get seat belts or <br />
<span class="left">helm</span>ets.  We also have to smile when it’s over.
<br /><br />
Physical discipline is a habit.  Enduring pain is a habit.  The foo<span class="left">tball</span> players asked to be <br />
transferred out of my group.
<br /><br />
I kicked ass at the physical training.
<br /><br />
<br />
<b>Skills</b><br />
Turned out that I liked guns.  I didn’t think I would, but I did.
<br /><br />
If you have a <span class="left">girlfri</span>end who doesn’t want to ruin the cut of her jacket or the outline of her <br />
purse, I highly recommend the old Glock36 slimline.  All the stopping power, no unsightly <br />
pantylines.
<br /><br /><br />

<b>Tradecraft</b><br />
Codes, drops, surveillance, security, informants and how to run them.  R<span class="left">educe</span>d to its essence, <br />
tradecraft is all about lying—with words, or computer programs, or body language, or bank <br />
statements.  
<br /><br />
Lying and <span class="left">catch</span>ing other people’s lies.  
<br /><br />
Waiting.
<br /><br />
This was the hard part for me.  It took me years to learn how to wait.  Years and years.
<br /><br />
In a funny way, I’m only just now figuring it out.  And I learned from you.
<br /><br />

<br /><br />
Step 2:  puncture the oxygen line into the power cell and cover the hole with <span class="left">a piece</span> of <br />
masking tape.
