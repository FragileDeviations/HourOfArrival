<span style="font-weight:bold; font-style:italic;">Yesterday Morning</span>
<br /><br />
Dwayne was par<span class="left">king his</span> 4 by 4 when I drove into the lot.  I smiled and he waved back.  <br />
Apparently he had forgiven me for making eyes at Antolos.   I <span class="left">was a lit</span>tle flirtier than <br />
usual.  He liked that.  I made small talk, asked him where he drove in from.  He said <br />
some place in Lake<span class="left">wood</span> and I asked him if it wasn’t easier to come in I90 and he said <br />
yeah but this morning he had stopped to make an appointment with his mechanic and <br />
come in another way.
<br /><br />
“Listen,” I said.  “When Gus Antolos was here—that guy, y<span class="left">ou reme</span>mber—did he go <br />
anywhere else in the building?”
<br /><br />
“I think he was <span class="left">down in</span> the dungeon for a while,” Dwayne said.
<br /><br />
“Clean rooms, or interrogation, or the pen?”
<br /><br />
Dwayne shrugged.
<br /><br />
“Did you notice anything unusual when you w<span class="left">ere cleani</span>ng up?”
<br /><br />
“Sorry.”  Dwayne was beginning to look puzzled, his radar blank.
<br /><br />
“No…flowers, or anything?”
<br /><br />
Enli<span class="left">ghtenme</span>nt dawned.  Dwayne looked at me seriously.  “Listen, baby, creeps like <br />
that, they’ll break your heart.  You need an older man.  Somebody settled down.”
<br /><br />
I did my best to look disappointed.  “Maybe you’re<span class="left"> right.”</span>
<br /><br />
<span style="padding-left:250px;">*</span>
<br /><br />
Some days Dwayne is gone by 4:45, but that night he stayed until 5:18 exactly.  I <br />
watc<span class="left">hed the</span> other cars pull out of the lot one by one, and then went down into the <br />
dungeon.  Everything seemed to be in order, but then, it would.
<br /><br />
I didn’t know what I was looking for until a found <span class="left">it almo</span>st two hours later.  In the <br />
dumpster behind the building, a pair of latex gloves that smelled like bleach.
