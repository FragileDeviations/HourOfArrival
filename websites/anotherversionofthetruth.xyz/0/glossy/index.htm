The r<span class="left">ecr</span>uiter was a non-entity:  middle-aged, average height, no particular accent.  The <br />
sort of guy you couldn’t pick out of a line-up if he’d ba<span class="left">cked</span> over your dog with his SUV <br />
the week before.
<br /><br />
“You stopped skating at age 16?”
<br /><br />
“What?  I thought this was a clerical job.”
<br /><br />
“Junior Analyst I,” he said.
<br /><br />
“Why do you care?”  I frowned.  “I never men<span class="left">tioned</span> anything about skating on my <br />
application.”
<br /><br />
“We looked it up.”  He didn’t look away from his <span class="left">comp</span> screen.  
<br /><br />
One of my high school counselors used to tell me I should include skating on my resumes <br />
and college applications.  People assume high-performance athletes are very self-<br />
motiv<span class="left">ated pe</span>ople and hard workers, although in my experience “neurotic people with <br />
very intense parents” is closer to the mark.
<br /><br />
“You quit after 2/22,” he said.  “Why?”
<br /><br />
I lied.  It’s just something I do.  I’m good at it, because I am us<span class="left">ually</span> careful to make my <br />
lies out of as much truth as possible.
<br /><br />
“They changed the scoring system,” I said.
<br /><br />
“I beg your pardon?”
<br /><br />
“In the old sco<span class="left">ring</span> system, you started with a perfect score and then all you could do was <br />
fail.  It was like life.  But there was a scandal and they b<span class="left">rought</span> in the Code of Points <br />
system, where you score for doing jumps and turns and so forth.  Like merit badges.”
<br /><br />
“Merit badges?”
<br /><br />
“Girl Scout merit badges.”
<br /><br />
“I see.”  He looked back at his computer and I had the funny feeling he was reading an <br />
entry ab<span class="left">out t</span>he time I got thrown out of the <span style="color:#95B3D7">Girl Scouts</span>.  And that he knew the Code of <br />
Points system had become mand<span class="left">atory</span> three years before 2/22.  
<br /><br />
“And that’s why you quit?”
<br /><br />
I looked at him.  “Mostly.  Plus, when you get boobs it throws off your rotations and you <br />
have to relearn <span class="left">every</span>thing.  Most of the girls are on drugs to keep them from hitting <br />
puberty, but …”
<br /><br />
“Really?” he said.  As if for the first time I’d said something that clicked with him.  <br />
“Interesting.”

I am in a toilet stall in the bathroom of a nice French restaurant.  I slip the top off a <br />
dis<span class="left">posable</span> syringe, kick off one shoe, and stick the needle through my pantyhose, into the <br />
webbing between the big toe on my left foot and the toe <span class="left">nex</span>t to it.  The stuff in the <br />
syringe is redder than my blood.  
<br /><br />
By the time I throw away the needle in the special garbage for Feminine Products my <br />
salivary glands are starting to clench.

—Resume:

<span style="font-weight:bold; font-style:italic;">Ele<span class="left">ven</span> years ago…</span>
<br /><br />
I figured the recruiter knew I was lying and I was screwed be<span class="left">cause</span> not only would I not <br />
get the job, but even if I caught all my buses perfectly I was going to be late for my shift <br />
in the Pr<span class="left">oduce</span> Section.  I hated Produce, but it was still better than working the registers.
<br /><br />
“Are we almost done, here?” I said.  “I just want a chance to help my country.”  (And get <br />
on the government health care plan bec<span class="left">ause</span> my Mom’s a drunk and lost her coverage and <br />
I wouldn’t be covered in another three months anyway.  But why mention that?)  “This is <br />
my fif<span class="left">th int</span>erview in the last three days, not counting the entrance exams and the <br />
supplementary exam and two personality inv<span class="left">entories</span>, and to be honest I’m losing a ton of <br />
hours at SuperStockit.”
<br /><br />
“Have you ever handled a gun?” 
<br /><br />
And for once the recruiter looked away from his co<span class="left">mput</span>er screen, right at me.  That <br />
for<span class="left">gettabl</span>e face.  I can’t even remember the color of his eyes.
<br /><br />
I said, “What job is this again?”
<br /><br />
“Junior Analyst I,” he said.
<br /><br />
Turns out there are pe<span class="left">ople</span> in the world a lot better at lying than me.
<br /><br />
Not that this is any surprise to you.
