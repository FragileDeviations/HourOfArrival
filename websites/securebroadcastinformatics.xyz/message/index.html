As I write this, cops are coming to arrest me and my friends for trying to make America a better place to live. I'm an IT specialist, they are mostly scientists, ranging from graduate students to eminent professors. None of us are soldiers. None of us wanted to hurt anybody. We weren't in favor of violenceâ€”just the same free speech that used to be your right under the constitution.

If you look down, you will see an email I got two days ago. Is this the kind of country you want to live in? Are these the choices you want to make?

If you wanted a job here at SBI, ask yourself *which America do I want to defend?*

If you think about that for even a little while, be careful: the cops will be coming for you next.

PS I'm sorry, Elaina. If they had come to me even a little sooner, I would have betrayed my friends to save you. Now it's too late for any of us.

Als sie mich holten,
gab es keinen mehr,
der protestieren konnte.

>>Dear Sir:

>>>>It has come to the attention of the Bureau of Morality's Internet Monitoring Taskforce that several of the clients for whom you handle IT seem to show bandwidth loads that do not match their formally submitted audit numbers.

We have asked for clarification of this matter on three occasions. Your replies have been either evasive or insufficient or simply late. Frankly, speaking as one human being to another, it has been as bad as dealing with a health insurance company.

>You may be aware of that frustration yourself, in the lengthy delays you have encountered trying to process the papers for your wife's breast cancer treatments. So I know you understand our frustration, and will be motivated to do your very best to explain these bandwidth discrepancies.

>>>>>>>>>You may submit any information in the full confidence that it will remain anonymous.

Perhaps your wife will start feeling better soon.
