<span style="font-weight:bold;">Executive Summary</span>
<br /><br />
The Re<span class="one">d Horse bio agent is e</span><!--xtremely hardy, presenting many of the same symptoms of the --><br />
Ebola virus without the attending fragility one would expect of a tropical virus in temperate or <br />
high-altitude climates.  Under this administration’s Dire<span class="left">ctive 21-03 “Eye f</span>or an Eye,” clinical trials of <br />
the replicated Red Horse strain against interred Islamic jihadist prisoners resulted in 100% mortality <br />
wi<span class="two">thin 48 hour</span><!--s of exposure.-->
<br /><br />
Interestingly, whereas Ebola patients suffer tremendous and incapacitating pain, Red Horse <br />
subjects acquire a degree of homicidal psychos<span class="three">is that can blind</span><!-- the subject to his own pain and --><br />
impending mortality.
<br /><br />
This video, of capture<span class="two">d U.S. Diplo</span><!--mat Jed Mather, shows the effects of the virus.-->
<br /><br />
Upon inhalation, Red Horse patients begin to bleed out.  Massive hemorrhaging follows with <br />
subjects bleeding from lachrymal ducts, ears (via ce<span class="leftUp">rebral spinal fluid) an</span>us and urethra.  In 65% of <br />
th<span class="one">ose subjects tested, ext</span><!--ernal stressors exacerbated the hemorrhage resulting in full mortality --><br />
within 45 minutes.  Unlike Ebola, full hemorrhagic fever did not present, nor did patients live long <br />
enough to manifest symptoms of n<span class="left">ecrotic organ tissu</span><!--e.  In all cases, cause of death was --><br />
determined to be massive hypovolemic shock.
<br /><br /><br />
 
<span style="font-weight:bold;">Developm<span class="leftUp">en</span>t</span>
<br /><br />
Appr<span class="one">oximately two yea</span><!--rs ago, a weaponized biological agent code-named Red Horse was --><br />
discovered within a laboratory facility inside the Caspian port-sector of Cheleken, Turkmenistan.  <br />
The facility poses as an environmental t<span class="left">esting facility b</span><!--ut is known to be a hub for jihadist CBRN --><br />
operations.
<br /><br />
Assets in-theatre tracked delivery of Red Horse by air into Dushanbe, Tajikistan.  Hand-off of the <br />
agent<span class="two"> to known jiha</span><!--dist sympathizers was captured before vectoring a UAV asset to follow --><br />
subsequent delivery by land south across the Va<span class="left">ksh River to a vill</span>age of approximately 15 <br />
families outside of Kulyab.
<br /><br />
The agent w<span class="left">as then disper</span>sed.  Sat recon suggests a portable pesticide sprayer was used.
<br /><br />
The agent proved 100% effective within the village.  From Patie<span class="one">nt 0 to  Patient Om</span><!--ega, (73 --><br />
persons) it is believed that 51 hours had elapsed.
<br /><br />
While Taji<span class="three">k nationals are not overt s</span><!--ponsors of the jihadist movement, Muslim sympathies negate --><br />
serious antipathy.  It is reasonable to believe that this Kulyab Event was a beta test of Red Horse <br />
prior to deployment ag<span class="two">ainst CO</span><!--NUS.-->
<br /><br />
F<span class="two">ollowing the Kulyab Eve</span><!--nt, our assets recovered the Tajik courier, Hamid Al-Mahvand, a second --><br />
sample of Red Horse and plans for a Site B contingency test location, also in Tajikistan.
<br /><br />
Subsequently we received the Jed Mather video.  It is clear that jihadist cells have sufficient <br />
quantities of this virus tha<span class="three">t they want us to kn</span><!--ow that they have it.-->
<br /><br />
The Tajik Red Horse trial proved that the agent is sufficiently deadly that a full TRVA was <br />
condu<span class="leftUp">cted.  A vaccine de</span>velopment program has proven to be a qualified success, but has <br />
demonstrated several symptoms that cannot, as of this date, be countered without diminishing the <br />
effi<span class="two">cacy of the vac</span><!--cine.-->  
<br /><br /><br />

<span style="font-weight:bold;"><span class="left">Con</span>clusion</span>
<br /><br />
CIA threat-risk-vulnerability analysis concludes that Red H<span class="three">orse presents a dir</span><!--e threat to both the --><br />
Administration and its backers.  Because Red Horse is believed to be at the disposal of <br />
di<span class="one">spersed jihadist ope</span><!--ratives that may or may not be currently within CONUS, it is the --><br />
recommendation of the CIA that:
<br /><br />

This <a target="blank" href="video/redhorse_24_9_1.mp4">video</a>, of captured U.S. Diplomat Jed Mather, shows the effects of the virus.
<br /><br />
Upon inhalation, Red Horse patients begin to bleed out.  Massive hemorrhaging follows with <br />
subjects bleeding from lachrymal ducts, ears (via cerebral spinal fluid) anus and urethra.  In 65% of <br />
those subjects tested, external stressors exacerbated the hemorrhage resulting in full mortality <br />
within 45 minutes.  Unlike Ebola, full hemorrhagic fever did not present, nor did patients live long <br />
enough to manifest symptoms of necrotic organ tissue.  In all cases, cause of death was <br />
determined to be massive hypovolemic shock.
<br /><br /><br />
 
<span style="font-weight:bold;">Development</span>
<br /><br />
Approximately two years ago, a weaponized biological agent code-named Red Horse was <br />
discovered within a laboratory facility inside the Caspian port-sector of Cheleken, Turkmenistan.  <br />
The facility poses as an environmental testing facility but is known to be a hub for jihadist CBRN <br />
operations.
<br /><br />
Assets in-theatre tracked delivery of Red Horse by air into Dushanbe, Tajikistan.  Hand-off of the <br />
agent to known jihadist sympathizers was captured before vectoring a UAV asset to follow <br />
subsequent delivery by land south across the Vaksh River to a village of approximately 15 <br />
families outside of Kulyab.
<br /><br />
The agent was then dispersed.  Sat recon suggests a portable pesticide sprayer was used.
<br /><br />
The agent proved 100% effective within the village.  From Patient 0 to  Patient Omega, (73 <br />
persons) it is believed that 51 hours had elapsed.
<br /><br />
While Tajik nationals are not overt sponsors of the jihadist movement, Muslim sympathies negate <br />
serious antipathy.  It is reasonable to believe that this Kulyab Event was a beta test of Red Horse <br />
prior to deployment against CONUS.
<br /><br />
Following the Kulyab Event, our assets recovered the Tajik courier, Hamid Al-Mahvand, a second <br />
sample of Red Horse and plans for a Site B contingency test location, also in Tajikistan.
<br /><br />
Subsequently we received the Jed Mather video.  It is clear that jihadist cells have sufficient <br />
quantities of this virus that they want us to know that they have it.

<span style="font-weight:bold;">Conclusion</span>
<br /><br />
CIA threat-risk-vulnerability analysis concludes that Red Horse presents a dire threat to both the <br />
Administration and its backers.  Because Red Horse is believed to be at the disposal of <br />
dispersed jihadist operatives that may or may not be currently within CONUS, it is the <br />
recommendation of the CIA that:
<br /><br />
	<span class="indent">•Continued discretionary funding be diverted to increase safer, faster production of the</span><br />

<br /><br />
	<span class="indent">•Existing supplies of the vaccine be provided for National Command Authority, the most</span><br />
	  <span class="indent">senior strategic positions of the Administration and key corporate and religious figures,</span><br />
	  <span class="indent">then increasing distribution to less-senior positions as inventory permits; and,</span>
<br /><br />
	<span class="indent">•Restrict all knowledge of Red Horse to this distribution list’s eyes only to permit deniability</span><br />
	  <span class="indent">and mitigate panic.</span>
<br /><br />
Should Red Horse fall under the umbrella of public scrutiny, we should anticipate a panic with <br />
severe repercussions to both economic and foreign policies.  Considering Red Horse’s efficacy, a <br />
public scare uncontained by official Vox channels risks provoking a “use it or lose it” attitude among <br />
jihadist operatives inside CONUS.
