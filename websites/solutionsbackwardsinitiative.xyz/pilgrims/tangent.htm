In that case, how far back does qua<span class="one">ntum computing</span><!-- go? -Miguel-->

It really s<span class="two">tarted to ki</span><!--ck in about 15 years ago. -Kalpesh-->
<br /><br />
that’s not far off our dept<span class="leftBold">h limit. -E</span>
<br /><br />
But if we can in<span class="leftUp">crease our de</span>pth, can we not try going further back?  At least we can try, on this first test?  I think it <br />
would be much <span class="one">more effe</span>
<br /><br />
I’m in favor of minus 15. I’d rather increase our probabi<span class="leftBold">lity of success on the f</span><!--irst try and then try to increase depth --><br />
on subseq<span class="three">uent efforts. -Caro</span><!--lina-->
<br /><br />
goddamn. i’m unde<span class="one">cided. yi has an awfully goo</span><!--d point... what if 15 years is too recent to do any good? -Eva-->
<br /><br />
15 years will do much more good than 15 nanoseconds. -Miguel
<br /><br />
I vote minus 15. I’m with Carolina. If this works, we have a LOT to say. We’ll b<span class="left">e doing this as oft</span>en as we can. <br />
-Jordan
<br /><br />
wow. guys, t<span class="one">hink about it. if this w</span><!--orks, what might happen to us after this first test? -Eva-->

Pray to your gods that the alt universe guys are crac<span class="leftUp">kpots. </span>-Kalpesh
