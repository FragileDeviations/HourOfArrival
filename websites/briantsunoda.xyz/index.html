<br /><br />
We have accumulated reports from individuals who claim to have seen the Presence throu<span class="left">ghout t</span><!--he United States.--><br />
From those reports we have distilled a set of six common themes that appear in a high percentage of accounts:
<br /><br />
	<span style="padding-left:25px;">1.  Giant hand/arm</span><br />
	<span style="padding-left:25px;">2.  Culpability (personal or collective)</span><br />

<br /><br /><br />

Additionally, we have discovered four themes that appear in a small number <span class="leftUp">of accounts a</span>nd which do not appear in <br />

These last 4 them<span class="left">es represent</span> less than 15% of the total reports. We hypothe<span class="left">size that the</span><!--se reports are false--><br />

<span style="font-size:16px; font-weight:bold; font-style:italic;">Abstract</span>
<br /><br />
The recent spate of appearances of the phenomenon popularly known as “The Presence” might too easily be<br />
dismissed as mass hysteria, when in fact it is possible that this phenomenon has an undiscovered but<br />
comprehensible physical explanation. Here we set forth proposed methods for quantifying the effects of the <br />
Presence, along with a discussion of explanatory theories for the phenomenon’s cause.
<br /><br /><br /><br />



<span style="font-size:16px; font-weight:bold; font-style:italic;">Describing the Presence</span>
<br /><br />
The first reports of the phenomenon widely known as “The Presence” were recorded on February 4.  Reports of the<br />
phenomenon came from all parts of the globe and have continued since that date.  Media reports have been limited<br />
since the first day, possibly in an effort by the government to prevent widespread panic, but reports continue to appear <br />
hourly on unofficial channels.
<br /><br />
A typical first-hand account of the Presence begins with seeing an immense hand reaching into the ground, followed<br />
by an intensely personal experience including a sense of culpability (either personal or collective), and often an<br />
overpowering sense of ongoing ecological disaster. It is one of the chief aims of this paper to move toward a coherent<br />
understanding of whether these accounts are purely psychological or are related to a legitimate external event.
<br /><br />
The Presence is not easily photographed or captured on video equipment. Some images do exist (Figure 1), although<br />
there is considerable debate over the authenticity and accuracy of these materials.

Still under investigation is whether there is a discernible pattern to the geographical locations or times of appearance. 
<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size:16px; font-weight:bold; font-style:italic;">Subjective Evidence: First-Hand Accounts</span>
<br /><br />
We have accumulated reports from individuals who claim to have seen the Presence throughout the United States. <br />
From those reports we have distilled a set of six common themes that appear in a high percentage of accounts:
<br /><br />
	<span style="padding-left:25px;">1.  Giant hand/arm</span><br />
	<span style="padding-left:25px;">2.  Culpability (personal or collective)</span><br />
	<span style="padding-left:25px;">3.  Hearing voices</span><br />
	<span style="padding-left:25px;">4.  Dissociation</span><br />
	<span style="padding-left:25px;">5.  Mention of either disaster or salvation</span><br />
	<span style="padding-left:25px;">6.  Mention of ecological issues</span><br />
<br /><br /><br />

Additionally, we have discovered four themes that appear in a small number of accounts and which do not appear in <br />
the most credible first-hand accounts of the Presence:
<br /><br />
	<span style="padding-left:25px;">7.  Giant face<br />
	<span style="padding-left:25px;">8.  Miraculous healing<br />
	<span style="padding-left:25px;">9.  Hearing quotes from specific existing texts<br />
	<span style="padding-left:25px;">10.  Reports of “lost time”<br />
<br /><br /><br />

These last 4 themes represent less than 15% of the total reports. We hypothesize that these reports are false<br />
positives: that is, hysterical or intentionally fabricated accounts, rather than authentic, subjectively honest first-person<br />
accounts. The chart below (Figure 2) shows the rate of appearance of these themes in the total population,<br />
contrasting with the rate of appearance after removing the false positives, which were determined by eliminating any<br />
account that referenced any of themes 7-10 or which did not reference at least two of themes 1-6 above.

<div style="position:absolute; left:57px; top:1827px; font-size:11px; font-weight:bold;">
Figure 2: Rate of Incidence of Themes in Total “Witness” Population vs. Validated Witness Population
</div>




<div style="position:absolute; left:13px; top:1863px;">
Interestingly, while about 10% of the apparently valid reports did not refer to ecological issues, absolutely none of the<br />
supposed “false positives” did.
<br /><br />
The larger question remains of whether first-hand accounts represent an epiphenomenon of consciousness or <br />
whether they represent a valid perception of reality, albeit filtered by human consciousness.
<br /><br /><br /><br />


<span style="font-size:16px; font-weight:bold; font-style:italic;">Objective Evidence: Physical Effects</span>
<br /><br />
<span style="font-weight:bold;">Meteorological Data</span><br />
Meteorological data for the Eastern seaboard for February 4 indicates that indeed, at least some reports of the <br />
Presence correlate to meteorological events.  Two reports of the Presence in West Virginia (both of which failed the <br />
validity test outlined above) in fact occurred within 5 miles and within 30 minutes of a funnel cloud appearing on <br />
doppler radar. A funnel cloud or small tornado is most likely the event that triggered both reports.
<br /><br />
<span style="font-weight:bold;">Power Grid Surges</span><br />
Preliminary findings indicate a slight power surge in urban centers during the Presence’s appearances, although it is <br />
yet to be determined fully whether these differences are statistically significant, and if so, whether they are causally <br />
related to the Presence.
<br /><br />
<span style="font-weight:bold;">Traffic Disruptions</span><br />
Traffic patterns have certainly been disrupted during appearances of the Presence. A prominent example is the <br />
multi-car accident on the Zakim Bridge in Boston on February 4. According to preliminary figures gathered from news <br />
media sources, appearances of the Presence seem to be accompanied by significantly higher-than-normal accident <br />
rates, although these numbers must be confirmed against official records.
<br /><br />
In general, traffic disruptions do appear to be triggered by human reactions to the event, rather than by physical <br />
disruptions.  Traffic signals, toll booths, and other automated systems do not appear to malfunction more than usual <br />
during appearances of the Presence.
<br /><br /><br />


<span style="font-size:16px; font-weight:bold; font-style:italic;">Explaining the Presence: Outlining Origin Theories</span>
<br /><br />
<span style="font-weight:bold;">A Psychogenic Event</span><br />
Mass psychogenic illness is a convenient way to dismiss this phenomenon, but one of the aims of this paper is to <br />
provide compelling evidence that this explanation is insufficient to account for the Presence, although collective <br />
hysteria may in fact be one of the effects. A large number of people (current estimates range from 5,000 to 75,000) <br />
experienced the Presence on February 4, before any public discussion had taken place. Many experienced it <br />
individually, rather than in crowds, discrediting the idea that herd behavior is a sufficient explanation.
<br /><br />
<span style="font-weight:bold;">Extraterrestrial Communication</span><br />
The anecdotal evidence certainly indicates a strong psychological reaction that is intensely personal but also appears <br />
to be categorically different from demonstrably psychogenic events, such as stigmata.
<br /><br />
The perception of a “huge arm” is probably an anthropomorphic/neurological bias, but the attendant personification <br />
goes beyond the awe normally associated with geological or meteorological events. The question arises whether this <br />
phenomenon is an attempt to communicate by a class of being which humans may not even be able to perceive <br />
physically.
<br /><br />
<span style="font-weight:bold;">Meteorological Phenomenon</span><br />
A third possibility is that the Presence represents a heretofore rare or non-existent weather phenomenon, possibly <br />
precipitated by climate change.  The intense personal reaction is certainly warranted: imagine the psychological <br />
impact of encountering thunder and lightning for the first time.
<br /><br /><br />


<span style="font-size:16px; font-weight:bold; font-style:italic;">Conclusion</span><br />
While the Presence is a phenomenon surrounded by controversy and uncertainty, there are myriad resources at our <br />
disposal to determine the precise effects and cause of this mysterious event. Whether this is a mass psychogenic <br />
event, a previously undiscovered meteorological phenomenon, or in fact the appearance of an alien presence, it <br />
behooves the scientific community to give careful consideration to this event of great international significance, and <br />
devote sufficient resources to discovering the true story behind the mystery of the Presence.  Enormous amounts of <br />
research money should immediately be poured into this area, particularly my lab, blah blah blah…  &lt;Brian to polish&gt;
