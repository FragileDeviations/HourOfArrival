Today while we were working on the greenhouse Grandpa started talking about what it was like to <br />be a campaign worker.  That’s what he was a long time ago.  He had to explain to me what an <br />election was because my memory was sort of hazy.  But he explained it and I said, “So it’s sort of <br />Celebrity Hook-Up, only the winner gets to be run the country.”<br /><br />He didn’t say anything.  Just looked at me.<br /><br />And then I said, “You got to vote on who is going to be President, but I only get to vote on who <br />Rebekah is going to date this week?”<br /><br />And then I said, “That’s fucked up.” <br /><br />And he was looking at me, and the longer I thought about it, the more fucked up it seemed.  Like, <br />how my life was this horrible joke version of his. Ha ha!  This is what “voting” means for you, Jerry <br />Snow, ha ha!<br /><br />And I said, “That’s really fucked up!”<br /><br />That was the first time I ever remember seeing Grandpa smile.
