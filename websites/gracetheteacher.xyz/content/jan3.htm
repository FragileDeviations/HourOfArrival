Grandpa picked us up today. After we got dad’s wheelchair in the back and all our clothes the <br />
Highlander was so packed you couldn’t see out the back window. 
<br /><br />
Grandpa lives in the country.  The nearest town is Dorset, which has three roads and a gas station <br />
where you can buy beef jerky and a boarded up beauty salon and a bar. 
<br /><br />
Mom’s going to home school us because there isn’t a church school out here and the public <br />
school doesn’t run bus service.  So it’s going to be Hannah and me doing worksheets at the <br />
kitchen table, I guess.   
<br /><br />
Hannah is a trooper.  I caught her crying about leaving her middle school girlfriends but she <br />
made me promise not to say anything to Mom and Dad.  I guess I’ll probably miss my friends too.
