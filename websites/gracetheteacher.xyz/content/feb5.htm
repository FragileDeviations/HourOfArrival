Hannah is the same which is not good. They won’t let us see her. Mom says she is in God’s hands. I <br />want to puke.<br /><br />Is this my fault?  For the things I thought and the things I did?  God, don’t take Hannah because of <br />me. <br /><br />I feel guilty because while we’ve been here we’ve had fast food and it tasted great.  Even the water <br />here tastes normal after well water.  The hospital has a computer that you can use and wireless. <br />Wireless is nice after having to put up with dial-up out in the country.  I shouldn’t be thinking <br />about wireless and dial-up while Hannah is so sick.
