<span style="font-size:12px;">Sir, I cannot stress enough the importance of discretion. The AU investigators are more and more feeble but they will make matters <br />difficult for me if I fall under strong suspicions. I remind you, contact via telephone is strongly inadvisable. I request you do not call <br />again unless it is truly of direst consequence.<br /><br />If I am hampered in my efforts here, I assure you that my associates will not feel friendly towards you.<br /><br />Moving ahead: your shipment of goods has left the country. You will find several pieces of particular quality. We have made all effort to <br />assure adequate refrigeration during this transport.<br /><br />For the younger recipients, we have made contacts with several orphanages which, I am pleased to report, are providing excellent <br />product. A-J continues to insist on age restrictions, so you will not find these goods through official channels, even at premium cost.<br /><br />Additionally, I may be able to offer unique access to fresh, top-quality product that is more difficult to acquire: of course I refer to those <br />goods which are not redundant in the source. Naturally the cost is high and we would prefer to bundle all goods from that source in a <br />single purchase.<br /><br />Please confirm receipt of shipment before placing your next order.
