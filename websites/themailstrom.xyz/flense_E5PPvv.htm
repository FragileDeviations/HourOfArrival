Dear Miss Novak:
<br /><br />
If you did in fac<span class="one">t send informati</span><!--on to your high school principal fraudulently accusing someone of subversive activities, --><br />
then you are liable for criminal prosecution.  Howe<span class="leftUp">ver, our questioning o</span>f Heath Sandleben reveal<span class="left">ed that he doe</span>s, in <br />
fact, harbor subversive sympathies.  I think that this is a misguided attempt on your part to protect a young man that <br />
you still h<span class="two">ave feelings f</span><!--or.-->  
<br /><br />
I want you to know that you should not se<span class="leftUp">cond guess yourse</span>lf in this matter.  What you did was the right thing, as I <br />
think close examination of your own conscience will tell you.  Perhaps you should speak to a school guidance counselor <br />
or your pas tor about this.
<br /><br />
Since rely,  <br />

<span class="leftUp">Dear Mr. D</span><!--ale Hajdik,-->
<br /><br />
I am sending you this email because I would like to take back what I said about Heath Sandleben.  I know I told the <br />
school about th<span class="three">ose anarchist signs an</span><!--d all that, but they were just because some friends of his tried to start a band--> <br />
back when we were Freshman and they didn’t really know anything about anarchy an<span class="two">d all that, they just t</span><!--hought it was--> <br />
cool.  I sent that email because I was mad at Heath.  He isn’t really an anarchist.  I was mad because he broke up with <br />
me.  If anyone should get in trouble it should be me and Heath shouldn’t have to go in the army.  He wouldn’t even be <br />
any goo<span class="one">d in the army becaus</span><!--e he’s not a jock or anything.-->  
<br /><br />
I know what I did is wrong.  I’m really sorry.
