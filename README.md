# Hour Of Arrival
A Year Zero revival project.

![63% Complete](https://progress-bar.xyz/63/?title=19/30+Restored)

# Notice
This repository is part of a non-commercial archival and preservation for the original Year Zero ARG.

This repository does not grant any license to redistribute or reuse this content for commercial purposes.

# Support
This is funded out-of-pocket, I am paying for hosting and the domains.

If you would like to support this, you can donate on PayPal (mabel@weatherelectric.xyz)

This is not for profit, all funds donated go directly to hosting.

# What Happens If I Can't Pay For It Anymore?
I will leave this repository up for preservation. I may not own the domains forever (but I want to own them for as long as I can), but this repository will always be available as a public archive.

Though do note that some files use links to my currently online sites and those would have to be fixed. Not a big problem to fix, though.
